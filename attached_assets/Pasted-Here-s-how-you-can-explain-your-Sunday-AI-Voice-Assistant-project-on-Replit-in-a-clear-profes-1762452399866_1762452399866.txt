### 🧠 **Project Name:** Sunday — AI Yoga Voice Assistant

### 💬 **Overview**

This project is an **AI-powered voice assistant** named **Sunday**, designed to help users interact with a yoga web application through **voice commands**. It combines **speech recognition, text-to-speech, and web automation** to create an interactive yoga assistant experience.

---

### ⚙️ **How It Works**

1. **Voice Activation:**
   The assistant continuously listens through your microphone for the wake word **“Sunday.”**

2. **Speech Recognition:**
   When it hears “Sunday,” it activates and listens for your next command (like “open pose library” or “start posture correction”).
   This uses the `speech_recognition` module and Google’s speech API to convert your speech to text.

3. **AI Understanding & Navigation:**
   Once it recognizes your command, it intelligently decides what to do:

   * Navigate to different sections of the **yoga web app** (like dashboard, routine, or AR correction).
   * Guide you through specific **yoga poses** (like *Tadasana*, *Downward Dog*, or *Warrior III*).
   * Provide **spoken feedback** or **pose descriptions** using natural speech.

4. **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
   Sunday talks back to you using `pyttsx3` (offline) or your system’s built-in voice (Windows SAPI or Linux `espeak`).

5. **Web Integration with Selenium:**
   The assistant automatically opens your local `index.html` yoga interface using **Selenium with Chrome** and interacts with it based on voice commands.

6. **Logging & Status Tracking:**

   * Every conversation is saved in `conversation_log.txt`.
   * System status (like “listening,” “speaking,” or “processing”) is saved in `sunday_status.json`.

### 💻 **Tech Stack**

* **Python Libraries:**

  * `speech_recognition` – For voice input
  * `pyttsx3` – For text-to-speech output
  * `selenium` – For controlling and automating the browser
  * `threading`, `json`, `os`, `time` – For system control and background tasks

* **Browser Automation:** Chrome WebDriver

* **Platform:** Works on Replit (with limited mic access) or locally on Windows/Linux.

### 🧘 **Example Commands**

Once Sunday is running, you can say:

* “**Sunday, open the pose library.**”
* “**Sunday, guide me through Warrior Pose.**”
* “**Sunday, start posture correction.**”
* “**Sunday, show my routine.**”
* “**Sunday, stop.**”

### 🧩 **What Makes It Special**

* Works **offline** for text-to-speech.
* Supports **human-like acknowledgements** (“Sure thing!”, “I’m on it!”).
* **Understands flexible commands** using keyword mapping and natural phrasing.
* Integrates **real-time browser control** with voice — blending AI and automation.
