# SUNDAY - Yoga Wellness Platform

## Overview

SUNDAY is an AI-powered yoga wellness platform that combines voice interaction with real-time pose detection and correction. The system uses a Python-based voice assistant (named "Sunday") to interact with users through a web interface that provides AR-based yoga pose correction using TensorFlow.js pose detection models. The platform features a dark-themed UI, real-time camera-based pose analysis, and audio feedback for wellness coaching.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Problem**: Need to provide an interactive, camera-based yoga pose correction system that runs entirely in the browser without requiring backend processing.

**Solution**: Client-side web application using vanilla JavaScript with TensorFlow.js for ML inference.

**Key Components**:
- **TensorFlow.js Pose Detection**: Real-time pose estimation running directly in the browser
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for dark-themed, responsive UI
- **Tone.js**: Audio synthesis library for feedback and ambient sounds
- **Camera Access**: WebRTC-based camera streaming for pose analysis

**Design Rationale**: Browser-based ML processing eliminates latency from server roundtrips and maintains user privacy by keeping video data local. The dark theme (#121212 background) provides better focus during yoga sessions.

### Backend Architecture

**Problem**: Need to serve static web content and provide voice-controlled interaction with the yoga platform.

**Solution**: Dual-component architecture with a simple HTTP server and a Selenium-based voice assistant.

**Components**:

1. **HTTP Server** (`server.py`)
   - Simple Python HTTP server serving static files on port 5000
   - Custom headers to prevent caching for development
   - No-framework approach for minimal dependencies

2. **Voice Assistant** (`assistant.py`)
   - Speech recognition using `speech_recognition` library
   - Wake word detection ("sunday") for hands-free operation
   - Text-to-speech using `pyttsx3` for audio responses
   - Selenium WebDriver for browser automation and interaction

**Design Pattern**: The voice assistant runs as a separate process that controls a Chrome browser instance, allowing voice commands to interact with the web-based yoga platform. This separation enables the platform to work standalone while the assistant provides enhanced voice-controlled features.

### Data Storage

**Problem**: Need to maintain conversation history and system status across sessions.

**Solution**: File-based JSON storage for lightweight persistence.

**Storage Components**:
- `sunday_status.json`: Tracks assistant state and configuration
- `conversation_log.txt`: Logs user interactions and system events

**Rationale**: File-based storage is sufficient for single-user desktop application without need for complex database infrastructure.

### Voice Interaction System

**Problem**: Provide hands-free, natural language interaction during yoga sessions.

**Solution**: Wake word-activated voice assistant with calibrated microphone settings.

**Implementation Details**:
- Dynamic energy threshold adjustment for varying ambient noise
- Pause threshold of 1.0 seconds for natural speech patterns
- Threading model for concurrent listening and browser control
- Energy threshold set to 3000 for optimal sensitivity

**Alternatives Considered**: Cloud-based speech recognition was considered but rejected to maintain privacy and reduce latency.

### Browser Automation Layer

**Problem**: Bridge voice commands to web application interactions.

**Solution**: Selenium WebDriver with Chrome in automation mode.

**Chrome Configuration**:
- Fake media stream for testing without physical camera
- Disabled web security for development flexibility
- No sandbox mode for containerized environments
- Autoplay policy bypass for audio feedback
- Hidden automation flags for cleaner UI experience

**Rationale**: Selenium provides robust control over the web interface, enabling the voice assistant to trigger actions, read status, and manage the yoga session programmatically.

## AR Pose Correction System

### Overview
The AR correction system provides real-time visual feedback on yoga pose accuracy using MoveNet pose detection and color-coded skeleton overlay.

### Pose Validation Architecture

**Problem**: Need to provide accurate, real-time feedback on pose correctness for 4 different yoga poses with varying difficulty levels.

**Solution**: Angle-based validation system with normalized scoring (0-100%) and color-coded visual feedback.

**Supported Poses** (Simplified to 3 Core Poses):
1. **Tadasana (Mountain Pose)** - Beginner
   - Validates: Body alignment, feet position, shoulder level
   - Key checks: Side angles (165-180°), feet distance, shoulder symmetry
   - Reference image: `assets/poses/tadasana.jpg`

2. **Vrikshasana (Tree Pose)** - Beginner
   - Validates: Standing leg balance, raised foot position, hand placement
   - Key checks: Balance on one leg, foot placement on inner thigh, hands in prayer position
   - Reference image: `assets/poses/vrikshasana.jpg`

3. **Namastey (Prayer Pose)** - Beginner
   - Validates: Hand position at chest center, elbow angles, shoulder relaxation
   - Key checks: Hands together, elbow angles (80-110°), shoulder symmetry
   - Reference image: `assets/poses/namaste.png`

### Scoring System

**Design**: Normalized percentage-based scoring with dynamic color feedback

**Scoring Formula**:
```javascript
finalScore = (overallScore / (checks * 25)) * 100
```

**Key Features**:
- Each validation check contributes up to 25 points
- Final score normalized to 0-100% regardless of number of checks performed
- Handles low-confidence keypoints gracefully by adjusting denominator
- Ensures 100% score is attainable when all available checks pass perfectly

**Color Coding**:
- **Green** (#10B981): Score ≥ 80% - Pose is correct
- **Yellow-Green** (#84cc16): Score 60-80% - Minor adjustments needed
- **Orange** (#FFC107): Score 40-60% - Moderate corrections required
- **Light Orange** (#FB923C): Score 20-40% - Significant corrections needed
- **Red** (#EF4444): Score < 20% - High risk, major form issues

### Real-Time Feedback

**Visual Overlay**:
- Skeleton rendered on video feed using MoveNet's 17 keypoints
- Skeleton color changes based on pose accuracy score
- Keypoints displayed as filled circles with white outlines
- Connections drawn as colored lines between joints

**Text Feedback**:
- Real-time score percentage display
- Specific correction suggestions per body part
- Check marks (✓) for correct positions
- Warning symbols (⚠) for minor issues
- Error symbols (✗) for major corrections needed

### Technical Implementation

**Pose Detection**:
- MoveNet SinglePose Lightning model for speed
- Minimum confidence threshold: 0.3 for keypoint validity
- 60 FPS target for smooth real-time tracking
- Mirrored video feed for natural user experience

**Angle Calculation**:
- Three-point angle calculation using atan2
- Handles 0-360° range with normalization
- Distance calculations for position validation
- Relative measurements for device-independent validation

**Performance Optimization**:
- Client-side inference eliminates network latency
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering
- Canvas overlay prevents video reprocessing
- Efficient skeleton connection algorithm
